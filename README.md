# Module-0 point-like events reconstruction

This repository contains code for reconstructing point-like energy deposits in data from ND-LAr prototypes. At the moment, the code only supports Module-0. There are (or will be) examples on simulating 39Ar and various radiological backgrounds, as well as comparing these simulations to data.

The way the reconstruction currently works (in a nutshell) is the following:
1. An h5py packets dataset is loaded and a selection of data is made (eventually it would run on the entire file)
2. ...
